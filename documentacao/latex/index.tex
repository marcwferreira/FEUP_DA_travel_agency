This project uses Algorithm conception studies in order to calculate the best travel routes for a fictional company with the goal of finding the best travel plan for a group of customer with given departure and arrival places.

This work was done within the scope of the Algorithms Development curricular course, and aimed at deepening the knowledge about conception of algorithms and dynamic programming.

With this simple program you can select the desired group size, origin and destination for a given graph (travel map), in which after you select from 2 possible cases and its subcases\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \mbox{[}1\mbox{]} 1\+: Max size of a group traveling \mbox{[}no group division\mbox{]}
\item \mbox{[}1\mbox{]} 2\+: Minimization number of bus changes vs. maximization of group size \mbox{[}no group division\mbox{]}
\item \mbox{[}2\mbox{]} 1\+: Find travel routes for a group of a determined size \mbox{[}group division\mbox{]}
\item \mbox{[}2\mbox{]} 2\+: Correct travel routes in case group size increases (number of bus changes can go up) \mbox{[}group division\mbox{]}
\item \mbox{[}2\mbox{]} 3\+: Calculate the max group size and travel routes between origin and destination \mbox{[}group division\mbox{]}
\item \mbox{[}2\mbox{]} 4\+: Minimum amount of time for the whole group to arrive at destination \mbox{[}group division\mbox{]}
\item \mbox{[}2\mbox{]} 5\+: Max amount of time a subset of the group may wait between connections (bus changes) \mbox{[}group division\mbox{]}
